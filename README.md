# Homestar Runner - Classic

This is Homestar Runner as it looked from its inception in 2000 till the death of Flash itself in 2021, combined with modern elements of the site to attempt to create what I feel is a better, actually more appropiately, a more coherent and repersentive version of the site.

*CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT - EXCUSE THE CRAPPYNESS, and moreover the broken links.*

## CHANGES FROM THE ORIGINAL SITE (as of the last update):

* I have merged the best parts from the current HTML5 Toons menu into the old Flash Toons menu. Therefore: Powered by The Cheat is back as a category, I have given Puppet Stuff its menu preview, and Video Stuff is also a category.

## CHANGELOG:

* 19/11/2022 - Created Repository, and created new version of Flash Toons Menu.

## CURRENT DEPLOY STATUS:
